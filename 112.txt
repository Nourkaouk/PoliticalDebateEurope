Enlargement is now often framed as ‘geopolitical imperative’’. The suggestion is that by integrating Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion, EU would demonstrate that it has now become ‘geopolitical’, as von der Leyen promised it would. 
What is odd about this, however, is that enlargement is the EU’s oldest foreign policy tool. In fact, enlargement was its substitute for a foreign policy at a time when, we are told, it was not geopolitical. In other words, the EU is using an old tool for a new purpose.
These debates illustrate the deep confusion about the idea of ‘geopolitical Europe’.
