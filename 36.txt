Arnault received the Grand Cross of the Légion d’honneur — France’s highest order of merit, which can only be held by 75 people at the same time.
Macron gave a “very Proustian” speech on the theme of time, according to a person close to the president, explaining how Arnault has been able to “see and build far ahead,” “tame the jolts of the short term” to “sell a form of eternal Frenchness.”
The head of state also spoke of the “deep roots” of LVMH CEO, a native of Roubaix in north of France, and his commitment to the reconstruction of Notre-Dame.
