Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk approved the reshuffle, which includes the dismissal of more than 50 ambassadors and the withdrawal of several candidates, the ministry said.
On Tuesday, Tusk announced that he and Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski would ask Polish President Andrzej Duda to make changes to most embassies.
The new pro-EU government of Tusk ― a former president of the European Council ― has vowed to restore democratic standards in the country and improve relations with Brussels, moving swiftly to purge people associated with the former Law and Justice government and to free state media from political control.
