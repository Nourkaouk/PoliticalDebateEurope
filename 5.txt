The political structure of the EU is similar to a confederation, where many policy areas are federalised into common institutions capable of making law; the competencies to control foreign policy, defence policy, or the majority of direct taxation policies are mostly reserved for the twenty-seven state governments (the Union does limit the level of variation allowed for VAT). 
These areas are primarily under the control of EU's member states although a certain amount of structured co-operation and coordination takes place in these areas.
For the EU to take substantial actions in these areas, all Member States must give their consent.
