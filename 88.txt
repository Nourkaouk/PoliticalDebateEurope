Bosnia and Herzegovina has reached full alignment with the EU Common Foreign, which is a significant positive step in these times of geopolitical turmoil.
The Commission considers that Bosnia and Herzegovina has achieved the necessary level of compliance with the membership criteria. Therefore, the Commission recommends to the Council to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, the Commission recommends that the Council adopts the negotiating framework once Bosnia and Herzegovina has taken further steps in line with the Commissionâ€™s report. The Commission is ready to report back to the Council about the progress made by Bosnia and Herzegovina.
