This time, however, it is different. Enlargement is not so much a way of blurring or softening the EUâ€™s borders, as it was in the 2000s, but of defining them more clearly or hardening them. 
This defensive enlargement of the EU is also taking place along civilizational lines. It is striking that although most discussions of enlargement focus above all on Ukraine, and also usually include Georgia and Moldova and even the countries of the western Balkans, Turkey is almost never mentioned. 
It is easy to argue that this is because of political developments in Turkey itself, especially since 2013.
