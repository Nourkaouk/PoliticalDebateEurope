President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Since we granted candidate status, Bosnia and Herzegovina has taken impressive steps forward. Of course, more progress is necessary to join the Union but the country is showing that it can deliver on its membership criteria and on its citizens aspirations to be part of our family. This is the reason for which we recommend to the Council to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. And we recommend that the Council adopts the negotiating framework once Bosnia and Herzegovina has taken further steps in line with the Commission’s report.”
