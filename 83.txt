Addressing the need for a more efficient and responsive EU, the discussion will explore ways to reform EU, empower citizens, engage member states effectively, and bridge the gap between EU institutions and the people they represent.
Topics will include promoting direct citizen engagement, reforming decision-making and conferring to the EU competences on an issue like security and defence.
The panels will aim to generate ideas and proposals for institutional changes that will make the EU fit for the challenges of the years ahead, strengthen the democratic foundations of the European Union, and ensure a more accountable and citizen-oriented governance structure.
