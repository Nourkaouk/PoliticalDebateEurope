With Russia announcing further increase in its armed forces by 170,000 new recruits to 1.3 million servicemen in total, there can be little doubt that the shift on the battlefield in Russia’s favour is gaining momentum.
Even if the European Council meeting in Brussels later this week delivers the opening of accession negotiations and more financial aid, further territorial losses, such as around Avdiivka, and another Russian campaign against Ukraine’s critical infrastructure over the winter would prove difficult for Kyiv and raise more questions about the sustainability of western support.
This leaves Ukraine and EU with difficult choices to make.
