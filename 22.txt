Von der Leyen’s seemingly impromptu proposal in February to use the profits for weapons for Kyiv has complicated the talks within the bloc because governments had previously agreed that this funding should go towards non-military spending, an European Union official said.
A statement from European leaders following their summit in October refers to the funds being used to support Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction, without mentioning military needs.
The Commission is expected to formally put forward its preferred option shortly before leaders meet next Thursday — and a group of countries, which includes Germany, is waiting until then to express their position.
