Chetwynd said AFP initially validated the photo, but that should never have happened as it “clearly violated” its guidelines.
Chetwynd said news agencies asked Kensington Palace to provide the original photo, but they did not receive reply. That’s when they decided to issue “kill notices,” something that is very rarely done.
“It’s a big deal for an agency to issue a kill [notice],” he said. “To kill something on the basis of manipulation … [we do it] once a year maybe, I hope less. The previous kills we’ve had have been from North Korean news agency or Iranian news agency.”
