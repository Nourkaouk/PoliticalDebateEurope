Noon Against Putin was the brainchild of St. Petersburg politician Maxim Reznik and it gained support from Navalny, uniting fragmented opposition groups, from left to right, behind the initiative.
The opposition knows it’s not perfect, but with the chances of a large-scale rebellion against Putin, it’s better than nothing.
“Holding any public protests in Russia is impossible. They immediately become pretext for arrest,” Fyodor Krasheninnikov, an independent Russian political analyst, told POLITICO. “That’s why people enthusiastically participate in events that, while not formally protests, are effectively acts of protest. Thus, Noon Against Putin should be viewed as a protest action.”
