The ‘hug in public, push in private’ strategy for Israel by the Biden administration and its allies is over.
The Biden administration and its allies used to reserve their criticisms of Israel for private conversations. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s floor speech Thursday, criticizing Israel for failing to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and calling for a new election there, served as the capstone to a monthslong U.S. pressure campaign that has moved from the shadows into the public sphere.  Typically pro-Israel voice to make such comments is a green light for any Israel critic to say their piece.
