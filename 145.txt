Mr Puigdemont has been thrust further into spotlight after Catalan President Pere Aragon√®s on Wednesday called snap election for 12 May, because parties were unable to agree on region's annual budget.
"The person we all have in mind will be in Catalonia on the day of the possible investiture debate," he said.
The timeframe of the amnesty bill's passage means it could be implemented shortly after the election.
The legislation will go to the Senate, which, although it is controlled by the conservative PP, can only slow its progress until mid-May, when it would return to Congress for final approval.
