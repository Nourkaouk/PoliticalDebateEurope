Israel claims to be letting in aid trucks, despite Lenarčič's denial.
But EU foreign-relations chief Josep Borrell, speaking at the UN Security Council in New York accused Netanyahu of sinister motives.
"Starvation is being used [by Israel] as a war arm [sic]," he said.
Borrell has been the EU's most vocal critic of Israel since Hamas attacks on 7 October.
"It does not make any sense to give me a dinner tonight, if you are going to kill me tomorrow," he said in Bahrain on 18 November, criticising the EU's focus on providing aid instead of pushing for a ceasefire.
