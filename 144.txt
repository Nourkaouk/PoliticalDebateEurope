Three years ago, Mr Sánchez's Socialist government granted pardons to nine Catalan separatists who were given long jail terms for their part in a 2017 independence declaration after a referendum declared illegal by the courts. The amnesty could benefit hundreds of people.
While Mr Sánchez has insisted the initiative aims to improve the social and political climate in Catalonia, his critics say it is unconstitutional and is purely aimed at maintaining the support of nationalists.
Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who is president of Madrid region for the opposition conservative People's Party, described it as "the most corrupt law of our democracy".
