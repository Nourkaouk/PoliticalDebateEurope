Poland dismisses 50 envoys appointed by old right-wing government
The Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the move is “not a retaliation” against the former Law and the Justice administration.
Poland is recalling more than 50 ambassadors appointed by the previous nationalist Law and the Justice government, in the latest effort by the new pro-EU administration to improve diplomatic relations abroad.
“The government … believes that the necessary change of Polish ambassadors will help to address the difficult challenges facing Poland’s foreign policy today in a better, more professional manner,” said Poland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement published Wednesday.
