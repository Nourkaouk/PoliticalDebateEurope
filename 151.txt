The EU's rules known as the "AI Act" take a risk-based approach: the riskier the system, the tougher the requirements -- with outright bans on the AI tools deemed to carry the most threat.
For example, high-risk AI providers must conduct risk assessments and ensure their products comply with the law before they are made available to public.
"We are regulating as little as possible and as much as needed, with proportionate measures for AI models," Breton told AFP.
Violations can see companies hit with fines ranging from 7.5 million to 35 million euros, depending on the type of infringement.
