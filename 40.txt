Relief for Pedro Sánchez as Spanish government’s Catalan amnesty bill clears major hurdle in parliament
Lower chamber of Spain’s parliament passes contentious legislation on a vote of 178-172.
MADRID — The lower chamber of Spanish parliament approved the government’s Catalan amnesty bill, meaning the contentious legislation has overcome a major hurdle on the way to implementation.
The bill received 178 votes in favor and 172 votes against, and it will now go to the Senate.
The amnesty initiative seeks to lift pending legal action against Catalan nationalists for separatist activity, particularly for their role in a failed 2017 bid for independence.
