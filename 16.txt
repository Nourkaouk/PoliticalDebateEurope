The result will mean billions of euros worth of weapons are sent to Ukraine — some of them directly by donors, whereas if countries give less they'll have to actually pay into the fund.
Bilateral arms shipments to Ukraine will be discounted from cash contributions to the fund at a level of 43 percent. That means for every €2.30 in weapons that a country gives Ukraine, it can deduct €1 from what it owes to the fund.
For all countries, this means as long as they give enough bilateral aid, they won’t have to give any new cash to the fund.
