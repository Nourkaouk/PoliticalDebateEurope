Polish farmers have been among those that have staged weeks of protest across EU to press a series of demands, including removing restrictions placed on them by the EU’s Green Deal plan to tackle climate change.
Poland’s farmers have particular grievance because of increased competition from neighbouring non-EU Ukraine’s farmers, who they accuse of flooding EU markets with cheap imports that leave them unable to compete.
Commission proposals concentrate on offering farmers more flexibility in heeding mainly environmental rules, such as to protect peat land, limit water pollution and soil erosion, while continuing to benefit from EU agriculture fund payments.
