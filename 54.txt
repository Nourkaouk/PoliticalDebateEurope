Even though the noon protest is likely to be symbolic at best, that hasn’t stopped control-freak Russian authorities from cracking down and looking to undermine it.
Significant disinformation campaign began, with Russian opposition activists receiving messages via email, Telegram and Signal falsely claiming the noon action was “postponed,” which was refuted by Navalny’s team.
A more ominous warning arrived Thursday evening, with Moscow Prosecutor’s Office warning people off coming to polling stations on Sunday at noon, threatening “criminal liability” as “these illegal actions may impede the free exercise by citizens of their electoral rights and the work of election commissions.”
