This follows the Commissionâ€™s recommendation for mandate, presented on 20 December 2023, based on the EU-Swiss Common Understanding which was reached after 18 months of intensive exploratory talks. The Swiss Federal Council adopted its mandate to launch negotiations with the EU on 8 March 2024.
The aim of the negotiations is to modernise and deepen bilateral relations between the EU and Switzerland. It will also ensure a level playing field for competition between respective companies operating within the internal market and guarantee the protection of the rights of EU citizens in Switzerland, including non-discrimination between citizens of different Member States.
