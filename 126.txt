A theme that comes up in the paper is the ‘depolitization’ of policy as a threat to democracy.
We understand depolitization of policymaking as a process of technocratically-driven economic decision-making becoming detached from the mechanisms of popular representation. That means a lot of economic policymaking has been outsourced by elected representatives to institutions outside of their control.
The example would be the role played by independent central banks. Their policy choices have real distributional consequences, even more since the global financial crisis as they became even more critical in macroeconomic management. However, there is very limited democratic control over them.
