Hungary and Slovakia — widely seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s best friends in the European Union — oppose purchasing weapons as they don’t want to contribute to what they see as a military escalation in Ukraine.
Others share the goal of supporting Kyiv but are frustrated by von der Leyen’s tendency to propose radical ideas without any prior consultation with the national capitals.
“There is a growing discontent against von der Leyen for improvising,” said an European Union diplomat.
The diplomat said von der Leyen's approach is “particularly disadvantageous for smaller member states,” that have more to gain from collective decision-making.
