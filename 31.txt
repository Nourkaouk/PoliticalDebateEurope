The photo had been released partly in an apparent bid to quell a surge of online conspiracy theories about the whereabouts and the well-being of Kate, who has not been seen in public since she underwent abdominal surgery earlier this year.

Kate later admitted to editing the photo, apologizing for “any confusion.” But the damage was done, as the scandal inflamed the crisis of trust already brewing in Kensington Palace.
