US ambassador to Budapest David Pressman also hit out at the Hungarian prime minister this week.
"Prime Minister Orban, who on the one hand baselessly claims the United States government is trying to overthrow his government, publicly calls for the political defeat of the President of the United States and actively participates in US partisan political events," the US envoy said on Thursday.
In his speech on Friday, Mr Orban reserved his most caustic remarks for the European Union and afterwards, as his supporters headed home, some harangued a lone protester, a young man with a blue European Union flag.
