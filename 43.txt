Sometimes even the best couples’ counseling can’t mend a broken relationship.
PARIS — Hopes are high that if anybody can help jumpstart the broken relationship between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron over Ukraine, it’s Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk.
For the first time since his reelection, Tusk will on Friday join the French and German leaders in Berlin for a summit of the until-recently dormant alliance of the trio known as the Weimar Triangle.
As a veteran politician and EU dealmaker, former European Council President Tusk seems ready-made to be the diplomatic mediator of the hour.
