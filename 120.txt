In coalitions which brought together left and right-wing parties, they had to seek compromise across significant political divides such as migration, housing and healthcare to form a government. 
If the Netherlands will again have a right-wing bloc as a government, it is bad news for Europe and the Dutch engagement abroad generally. As the gaps in policy positions between these four parties on issues like migration are much smaller than with left-wing parties, there might be less likelihood of internal fighting and government collapse over this particular subject. The Freedom Party, NSC and BBB are also united in their Euroscepticism.
