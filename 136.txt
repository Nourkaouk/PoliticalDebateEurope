Many theories have been put forward to explain the phenomenon, given the significant impact of populism on European electoral politics, yet these often fail to account for the heterogeneity of populism.
This paper presents theory of populism that can accommodate such contradictions. It treats populism as reaction to the distributional conflicts resulting from ‘hyperglobalization’, and connects its drivers to specific economic and political contexts. Among other factors, it finds that different types of populist protest tend to develop depending on whether the shocks from hyperglobalization are primarily to trade or financial markets, or manifest primarily as sudden increases in immigration.
