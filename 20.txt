In September 2022 European Parliament issued a statement saying “Hungary cannot be considered a full democracy” any longer.

“With other allies we engage, we collaborate, we work together — even where we have differences.  Here, that doesn’t work — until we act,” he warned.    
“We needn’t agree on everything, and we won’t. We needn’t even agree on most things,” Pressman said. “But there is clearly work to be done.”   
Orbán’s communications office didn’t respond to a request for comment.
