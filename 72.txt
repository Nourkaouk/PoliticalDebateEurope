EU president congratulates Putin on ‘landslide’ win … as Russian voting kicks off:
“No opposition. No freedom. No choice,” blasted Charles Michel.
The European Council president congratulated Vladimir Putin on his win in Russian presidential election — just as three days of voting began Friday.
“Would like to congratulate Vladimir Putin on his landslide victory in the elections starting today,” Michel snarked on social media. “No opposition. No freedom. No choice.”
Russians headed to the polls Friday for the first day of voting in a rigged election that Putin is almost certain to win, granting him another six years in power.
