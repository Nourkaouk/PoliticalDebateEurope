Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 prompted Sweden to seek greater security within NATO.
Ukraine formally submitted application to join the bloc in September 2022 and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy received assurances at the Vilnius Summit in the Lithuanian capital in July 2023, where Allies reconfirmed their commitment to make Ukraine a member.
Risks officers surveyed for the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2024 said “interstate armed conflict” was one of the top five most severe risks facing the world.
The Vilnius Summit included the inaugural session of the NATO-Ukraine Council on 12 July, where Zelenskiy was welcomed by Stoltenberg.
