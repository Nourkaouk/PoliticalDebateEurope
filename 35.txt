Macron gives France’s highest honor to world’s richest man 
A-list cast attended glittering ceremony for LVMH billionaire Bernard Arnault.
French President Emmanuel Macron awarded billionaire Bernard Arnault with France’s highest honor during a star-studded ceremony at the Elysée Palace, several people who were at the event told POLITICO.
Plans for the party were kept carefully under wraps as dozens of A-listers lined up in Paris behind closed doors to honor the LVMH boss and richest man in the world, including pop star Beyoncé and fellow billionaire Elon Musk, who had an unannounced one-one-one meeting with Macron right before the event.
