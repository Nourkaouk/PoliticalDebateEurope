The Commission pointed to its remarks on the subject from Friday’s midday briefing, when a spokesperson said: “It is clear that this comment is a personal remark and is not made in his capacity as a commissioner. The secretary-general will send reminder to all Commissioners about the guidelines that have been defined for the period of political campaign. we ask commissioners to exercise judgment in the application of these rules.”
One EU official, who like others quoted was granted anonymity to speak candidly, argued that the guidelines are “seen as a means of silencing any criticism” of von der Leyen.
