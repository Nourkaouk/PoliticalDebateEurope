The political foundation/think tank linked to Europe’s center-right political family boasted a space on the mezzanine of the plenary, just off the main entrance. You could come for the best coffee on site, brewed by Italian baristas, and stay for the policy gabfest. In addition to geeky debates with policy experts and national ministers on things like migration, defense, there were also a series of one-on-one interviews with lobbying execs from Intel, Meta, Google, and the pharma lobby EFPIA. A statement from the Martens Centre didn’t specify the price for these sponsorships, beyond affirming that they respect the €18,000 limit.
