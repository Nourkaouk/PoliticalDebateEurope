Mr Puigdemont is being investigated for terrorism-related crimes for his alleged role in protests in 2019.
However, his Together for Catalonia party voted against the amnesty in January, arguing that it failed to provide guarantees protecting him and several others from prosecution for terrorism.
The revised version of the bill stipulates that only crimes deemed terrorism by the EU, rather than Spanish law, will be unprotected by the amnesty.
The parliamentary support of Mr Puigdemont's JxCat and the fellow pro-secession Catalan Republican Left has been crucial in allowing Socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez to govern since his investiture in November.
