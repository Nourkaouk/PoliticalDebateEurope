The Freedom Party has the right to begin exploring options to form a government. The VVD has changed its position and said it will not govern as part of a coalition, but may still prop up a right-wing cabinet on a case-by-case basis. 
Newcomer centre-right New Social Contract, NSC, became the fourth largest party, and together with the right-wing Farmerâ€™s Party, the BBB, the Freedom Party could look at forming a minority coalition. As the BBB is the largest party in the Senate, adding them to the coalition would make it easier to pass legislation in the Senate at least.
