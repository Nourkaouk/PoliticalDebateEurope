Tusk might yet be “the game changer,” that the relationship needs, said Alberto Alemanno, law professor at HEC Paris. “He is leading the redemocratization of his country, his position is strong, he can really come as facilitator and get the best out of leaders,” he added.
“I don’t think [the Poles] can easily fix the Franco-German relationship,” said Piotr Buras of the European Council on Foreign Relations. 
“The sources of disagreement between France and Germany lie beyond Tusk’s reach. There are different approaches on a number of issues and a mutual lack of trust between Scholz and Macron,” he added.
