As European elections are fast approaching, the upcoming months will feature intense debates on matters such as energy change, and the evolving defence and security threats. What will be the impact of these debates on citizens’ participation in the European elections?
In the lead up to June 2024, the European Movement International and The Parliament magazine will explore key challenges facing the EU through a series of thought-provoking debates.
The “Road to European elections” series will engage policymakers, opinion leaders, industry voices, but mostly, citizens. We will hear from citizens across the EU, and analysing the impact of emerging trends.
