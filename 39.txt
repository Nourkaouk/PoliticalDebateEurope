Three other people said they heard what sounded like an explosion after police arrived at the scene.
Pelle Geertsen, a parliamentary assistant in the Left group, said on X he heard “what sounded like a small boom.” A political adviser, who was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said she heard “a noise that sounded like an explosion.”
MEPs, assistants and officials received a “crisis communication” text message from the Parliament’s authorities, stating: “Following a check of a vehicle by the French police and as a precautionary measure, the Churchill building (Strasbourg) and parking in/out are blocked.”
