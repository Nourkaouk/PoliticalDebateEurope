However, some countries will likely prefer to send money to the fund rather than give weapons directly to Ukraine, a senior EU official said.
"The bilateral in-kind contributions make sense for countries that have a big weapons industry, as they can buy from their own producers," the official said.
But that dry accounting procedure belies the excited talk in Brussels that greeted Wednesday's deal.
EU leaders, who took weeks to reach agreement on the package amid objections from France, Germany and Hungary, promptly flourished the deal as a victory for EU and Kyiv, which desperately needs more weapons and ammunition.
