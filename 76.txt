The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party’s sponsorship system is pretty straightforward. But don’t be fooled: Even a full-service package might not include everything you expect.
EU Influence viewed a menu of sorts, sent to consultancy, that offered a range of options: For €10,000 they could sponsor the annual party congress, another €5,000 to engage with the “Alliance of Her” program, and another €5,000 to sign up for “ALDE Party Organised Corporate Events in 2024.” That totals €20,000, which goes over the cap. That’s where the package deal comes in: You get all this and more for €18,000.
