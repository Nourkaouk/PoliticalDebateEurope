From the health of our publics to their quality of life, economic prosperity and the air they breathe, the citizens of Europe need a global vision — not just local action. 
Europeans need to remember what Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said last year: They need to grow out of the mindset that Europe’s problems are world’s problems, but that the world’s problems aren’t Europe’s problems.
They need the next European Commission and European Parliament to recognize the demands of interdependence and global risk, and that if these institutions don’t help solve global problems, they will undermine Europe’s security.
