While the Eurozone crisis has contributed to Europeanisation trends in the domestic politics of EU member states, it has not to the same extent triggered citizen mobilisation in EU-level democratic procedures. Theories that treat politicisation as an undifferentiated phenomenon tend to miss this important distinction. The weakness of supranational citizen mobilisation is linked to factors that restrict the citizensâ€™ receptiveness to EU-related messages: a weak sense of political efficacy, a discursive framing that conceptualises EU as a consortium of member states rather than a supranational entity, and attributions of responsibility for the crisis that de-emphasise the role of EU policies.
