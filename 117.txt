What a far-right surge in the Netherlands means for Europe:
The Netherlands is yet another European state to have swung to the right after the far-right Freedom Party won the largest number of seats in the national elections.
After Victor Orban’s long-standing reign in Hungary, far-right Giorgia Meloni took the lead in Italy, and Robert Fico’s pro-Putin party won Slovakia’s election, there is now a solid bloc of Eurosceptic leaning parties in power in Europe.
While each party has their agenda and they certainly do not hold monolithic views, the resurgence of democratically-elected far-right in Europe is reason for concern.
