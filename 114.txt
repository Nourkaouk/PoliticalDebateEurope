This is reflected in the idea of enlargement as a ‘geopolitical necessity’, that EU has no choice but to enlarge. Ironically, given that is taking place in response to Russian aggression, this recalls a famous dictum attributed to Catherine the Great: ‘I have no way to defend my borders but to extend them.’
In the 2000s, enlargement was open-ended. Ten countries – eight of them from central and eastern Europe – joined the EU in 2004. But this was not meant to be the end of it. Rather, there was a sense that the EU would continue to enlarge beyond these countries.
