A handful of governments have opposed European Commission President Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s plan to use profits generated by frozen Russian assets to buy weapons for Ukraine.
Hungary, Slovakia, Malta and Luxembourg pushed back against the idea during a meeting of EU's 27 ambassadors on Wednesday, according to six officials and diplomats who were granted anonymity to speak freely about private talks.
These fraught discussions might be a signal of what is to come during an EU summit next week, when leaders hope to decide on how to use the proceeds of the assets that have been immobilized in Europe.
