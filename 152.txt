"EU Ambassadors just agreed in principle on a 13th package of sanctions in the framework of Russia's aggression against Ukraine," Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said on social media platform X, calling it "one of the broadest approved by EU".
The new package will see 193 entities and individuals added to the list of those banned from traveling to EU, but no fresh measures against specific economic sectors.
The sources said the focus of the listings is roughly split between entities and individuals that are part of Russia's military industrial complex and those involved in kidnapping Ukrainian children.
