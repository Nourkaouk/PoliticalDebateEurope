Macron, who is the commander-in-chief of the country’s armed forces, declined to describe in which situation France would be ready to send troops. He said the responsibility for prompting such a move would lie with Moscow: “It wouldn't be us," adding that France would not lead an offensive into Ukraine against Russia.
Macron described the Russia-Ukraine war as “existential” to France and Europe.
“If war spread to Europe, it would be Russia’s sole choice and sole responsibility. But for us to decide today to be weak, to decide today that we would not respond, is being defeated already,” he said.
