The far-reaching regulation passed with the support of 523 lawmakers in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, with 46 voting against.
EU's 27 states are expected to endorse the text in April before the law is published in EU's Official Journal in May or June.
"Today is again an historic day on our long path towards regulation of AI," said Brando Benifei, an Italian lawmaker who pushed the text through parliament with Romanian MEP Dragos Tudorache.
"We managed to find that very delicate balance between the interest to innovate and the interest to protect," Tudorache told journalists before the vote.
