Should Israel refuse to change course, namely to safeguard Gaza’s 2.2 million Palestinians and seek a two-state solution, then the U.S. should play “a more active role in shaping Israeli policy by using our leverage to change the present course,” he said.
That hasn’t pleased other lawmakers, especially Speaker Mike Johnson, who called Schumer’s address “ highly inappropriate.”
