Police called to EU Parliament as staffers report hearing a loud bang
Car searched by French police after it was driven up to the Parliament building in Strasbourg.
Police were called to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday after an incident involving a car that approached the building.
The driver attempted to enter the Parliament earlier Wednesday, insisting on meeting MEPs, but was refused access, according to a Parliament official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The man later returned in a car, parking directly in front of the Winston Churchill building, after which French police arrived to investigate.
