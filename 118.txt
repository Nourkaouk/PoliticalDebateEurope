Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders has consistently had the same message on migration since leaving the VVD in 2006 to found his party. This has gone hand-in-hand with his inflammatory anti-Islam rhetoric and a strong anti-EU sentiment having advocated for a so-called ‘Nexit’ since 2016.
Until this election campaign, the other main parties had vowed not to work with the Freedom Party. In a parliament which requires 76 seats to obtain a majority and therefore cross-party coalitions to achieve this, the VVD made a critical error during this election campaign. It changed position and considered working with the Freedom Party.
