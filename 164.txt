In countries such as Spain and Ireland with no eurosceptic party in Parliament, EU is discussed to a greater extent by the larger parties. In countries where there is an eurosceptic party in parliament, the larger parties tend to discuss EU less. This is probably to prevent the eurosceptic parties from gaining more visibility.
Both media and parliaments tend to focus on EU policies rather than notions of European belonging and identity. These findings are common to all countries, and suggest that both arenas are contributing to enable citizens to form opinions on EU policies rather than questioning EU membership.
