Military aid is essential to Ukraine’s survival, but it is not sufficient. If EU does not approve its proposed €50 billion support for Kyiv, the country’s economic survival would be at risk because of the massive budget deficit that Ukraine keeps accumulating due to its war effort.
A failure by EU to open accession negotiations would also exacerbate the blame game at the top between Ukraine’s political leaders and the squabbling between government and opposition over Kyiv’s war strategy.
For now, Ukraine’s president, Zelensky, has doubled down on his efforts to defeat Russia militarily by announcing more mobilisation of troops.
