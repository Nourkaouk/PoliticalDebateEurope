Elections that few were really hot for. This is not surprising: for a long time, the European Parliament was mainly about the technical rules that applied in the European market. There was hardly any question of political struggle. European elections therefore became primarily a survey of the popularity of the EU. The higher the turnout, so it was thought, the greater the support. And judging by the turnout figures, it declined for decades.
The obsession with EU support turned European elections into a kind of referendum: are you for or against the EU, do you want more or less Europe?
