Biggest flaw in EU democracy is lack of political debate:
The European elections are just around the corner. Democracy in the EU has shortcomings, but the EU has mostly lacked political debate in recent decades. It is good that this is changing.
If you do not know what European elections are for, it is not up to you. For a long time, a vote in European elections was mainly a vote for the EU. That tide is turning, and that is good thing. Because European elections should not be a celebration of European unity, but a battle between political visions.
