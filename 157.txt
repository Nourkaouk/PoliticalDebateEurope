The first dimension concerns the role of mainstream media as agents of EU politicisation. In this chapter, we explore whether the ideological leaning of mainstream press (left vs. right) or the type of newspaper items (news vs. opinion articles) have an impact on the salience and tone of the news coverage of the EU. We are particularly interested in investigating whether the Eurozone crisis was associated with higher convergence, or divergence, in the news coverage of EU, within each country. The second dimension concerns the longitudinal changes in the way that the EU is reported, or debated, in the media.
