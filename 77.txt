Congress sponsorship includes access for up to five company reps for networking receptions and corporate roundtables, as well as the possibility of exhibition space. But an asterisk and fine print notes: “*Does not entitle representatives to any direct lobbying of elected politicians at congress.”
ALDE is nominating its Spitzenkandidat at special congress in Brussels later this month. But that’s not the congress on offer in the sponsorship package, the party stressed.
“During the election campaign, we are not doing partnerships,” said Iiris André, ALDE’s head of comms. That means “no corporate partners are present” at the “extraordinary” campaign kickoff congress.
