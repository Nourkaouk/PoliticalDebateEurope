Allies of French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday sought to cast the country's far-right forces as bedfellows of the Kremlin.
Speaking in northern city of Lille, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal lambasted the far-right National Rally, which leads Macron's alliance by wide margin ahead of June elections, and accused them of betraying the interests of France and Europe.
"They have always said 'no' to Europe," France's prime minister said.
"The only difference is that they are hiding it little and the 'no' has turned into a 'nyet'," Attal said, accusing Marine Le Pen's party of flirting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
