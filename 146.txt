The prospect of Mr Puigdemont, who is an MEP, being free of the legal charges and running for office in Spain again could provide a major boost to his JxCat as it seeks to reassert itself as Catalonia's dominant political force.
He said the amnesty did not mark an end to the story but overcame "an erroneous stage of judicial and political repression of a political movement".
The Spanish prime minister praised the vote as opening a "new period of coexistence and prosperity in Catalonia", but the Catalan president said it marked a "new stage towards achieving liberty for Catalonia".
