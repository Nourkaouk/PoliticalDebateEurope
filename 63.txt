“Schumer’s speech today marks a historic moment in U.S.-Israel relations. He is not only telling Israelis that the time has come to replace their leader, but he is opening the door to the possibility that the U.S. may condition future aid to Israel,” said Guy Ziv, a professor of Israeli politics at American University in Washington.
The Schumer’s address wouldn’t have been possible without the Biden administration’s own shifts in recent weeks, prompted by mounting political pressure from Democrats.
After the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack, Biden used public remarks to offer unequivocal support for Israel’s right to self defense.
