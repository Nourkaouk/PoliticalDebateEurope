Russian president, who spent years cracking down on any form of dissent against his rule, is expected to face off against three candidates who have voluntarily abstained from criticizing him. The only two significant anti-war opposition candidates, Ekaterina Duntsova and Boris Nadezhdin, have been disqualified.
Russia’s grassroots opposition has organized mass participation of voters at polling stations in a show of protest at Putin’s longtime reign over Russia.
Putin was elected as Russian president in 2000 — other than a break when he took on the role of prime minister between 2008 and 2012 — has held the top job ever since.
