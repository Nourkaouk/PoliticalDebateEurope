The Treaty of Lisbon celebrates its 15th anniversary on 13 December. Looking back, experts agree that it played a big part in structuring EU. It reinforced the role of Commission President, to be elected by the European Parliament and share power with a newly created President of the European Council, the body that brings together EU heads of government.
So, the treaty strengthened both the Commission and the Council, effectively creating a dual executive for the EU. Following the treaty changes, EU faced a succession of crises, including the Eurozone crisis, Brexit, the COVID pandemic, and the invasion of Ukraine.
