Breton — a supporter of Macron — stirred anger widely within the president’s centrist Renaissance party, two senior party officials told POLITICO, with one accusing the commissioner of “giving ammo to the EPP.”
European Commission Secretary-General Ilze Juhansone’s office circulated an email to remind commissioners not to undermine the institution which employs them.
“May I remind us all that … members of the Commission must behave with integrity and discretion … and they shall not express themselves, through whatever medium, in a manner which adversely affects the public perception of their independence,” read the email, which was obtained by POLITICO’s Brussels Playbook.
