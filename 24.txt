The "U.S., Canada and Europe have to do more, and we need a long-term commitment to enable the Ukrainians also to plan," the NATO secretary general said  at press conference following the unveiling of alliance's annual report.
"NATO allies are not providing Ukraine with enough ammunition and that has consequences on the battlefield every day," he added.
Stoltenberg also warned that it's a "huge challenge" as "the Russians are able to outgun the Ukrainians every day. Itâ€™s one of the reasons why the Russians have been able to make some advances on the battlefield over the last weeks and months,".
