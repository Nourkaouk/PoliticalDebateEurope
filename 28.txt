“Breton’s trying to attract attention and notoriety, it’s clear he wants to stay on as commissioner,” said another EU official.
The French official argued Breton’s behavior “weakens von der Leyen, while the current Commission remains in place at least until December, and the geopolitical situation does not allow for any unnecessary division. It’s a gift to Les Républicains and the [far-right party] RN, who never stop bashing her.”
Von der Leyen’s 2019 accession to the head of the European Commission came with crucial support from Macron, which has made her a target for criticism from French conservatives and far right.
