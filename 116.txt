EU’s return to enlargement in response to the invasion of Ukraine thus reflects both how it has failed to develop a new set of foreign policy tools since the 2000s and also how the way it thinks about itself and its place in the world has changed since then. 
EU claims it is increasingly ‘geopolitical’, and that its commitment to integrate Ukraine is an illustration of this. But the more meaningful and significant shift underway is that the EU is becoming clearer about who belongs to the European ‘community’– or ‘family’ as von der Leyen put it – and who doesn’t.
