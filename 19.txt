“We cannot ignore it when the speaker of Hungary’s national assembly asserts that Putin’s war in Ukraine is actually ‘led by the United States’,” he added.
A few hours after the speech was held, Orbán shared a video on X, formerly known as Twitter. In the video, he talked about the “difficult period in American-Hungarian relations.”
“The American administration expects things from Hungry that we don’t want to deliver and can’t deliver,” he said.
Hungary has been criticized by many for maintaining close ties to Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine. Its democratic backsliding has also worried other EU members.
