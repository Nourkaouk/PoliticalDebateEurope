Peter Magyar, a former Fidesz insider and 43-year-old businessman, launched new political party at rally of his own on Friday that attracted tens of thousands of people in Budapest.
In contrast with the prime minister, he called for constructive dialogue with the European Union and told supporters that he was setting up the "Stand Up, Hungarians" movement for all those fed up with the mistakes of the past three decades since the fall of communism.
"Every avalanche starts with a snowflake," he wrote earlier on Facebook, promising to challenge the "corruption and nepotism" that he said stained Viktor Orban's rule.
