A lot of politics is, and should be, about more than money and redistribution.
We argue in the paper that there is little space left for real debate on the economic questions, which have in many cases been outsourced to non-majoritarian, only semi-democratic institutions.
In Europe, this has been constrained even more by the structures and rules of the European Union (EU), including the fiscal rules, and a de facto consensus on many of these issues in the centre of the political spectrum. As a result, there is little point talking about those kinds of issues within the political sphere.
