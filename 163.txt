The research focuses on six countries â€“ Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain from 2002-2021. Combining founding members of EU with more recent entrants, these countries also differ in economic performance both before and after the Eurozone crisis.
The book notes an increasing importance of EU in the parliamentary debates. In terms of how they engage with EU, these two arenas have inherently different logics. The media has a negativity bias. Therefore, as the media coverage of EU issues grows, so does the negative tone toward it.
In parliaments, the larger parties control debates, and they tend to act strategically.
