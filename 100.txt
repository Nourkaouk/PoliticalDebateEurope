The Commission welcomes the political agreement reached between European Parliament and the Council of EU on the European Health Data Space â€“ one of the central building blocks of a strong European Health Union. The rules proposed by the Commission in May 2022 have two main aims:
To put citizens at the centre of healthcare, giving them full control over their data to obtain better healthcare across the EU;
To open up data for research and public health uses.
The agreement reached by the co-legislators establishes clear rules for the use of health data for better healthcare delivery, research, and policymaking.
