We reference a lot of academic work looking at whose policy preferences are reflected in political decision-making. Traditionally, this kind of work has been done about the US political system but there is a great deal of work being done in Europe. When it comes to how responsive political systems are to the interests of different classes, the situation in Europe is almost as bad as in US.
It’s the interests of the well-off that are translated into policymaking and the interests of those least well-off don’t feature nearly as much. So, as economic inequality increases, so does political inequality.
