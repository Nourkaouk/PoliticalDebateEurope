The aim here has been to stop people reaching European shores, but those fleeing conflict, economic crisis will continue to arrive — this is a strength not weakness, reflecting wealth and stability. We also have evidence that this approach doesn’t work and puts vulnerable people at greater risk, as smugglers simply divert to ever more dangerous routes. Moreover, it skews the EU’s foreign policy priorities — and when politics in a country like Niger, for example, change overnight, the EU is left short.
The alternative is simply clear legal routes — safe pathways to hope provided before people make risky journeys to Europe.
