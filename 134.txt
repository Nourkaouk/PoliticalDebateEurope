There seems to be greater satisfaction with democratic processes and institutions in Germany than in France or UK. But in many ways Germany is a more constrained democracy with the ‘constitutional’ pillar of liberal democracy being dominant relative to the ‘popular’ pillar. If German citizens really are happier with their democratic system than British or French citizens, it could either be because their system is better, or they are less demanding. Or, to put it in terms used by Irish political scientist Peter Mair, they may be happier with less responsive form of government because they value ‘responsible’ government more.
