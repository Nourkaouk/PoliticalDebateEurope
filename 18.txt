In uncommonly frank language, David Pressman chastises Budapest for “undermin[ing] trust and friendship.”
U.S. Ambassador to Hungary David Pressman criticized the country’s “dangerously unhinged anti-American messaging” and its “expanding relationship with Russia”.
In a fiery speech at the Central European University in Budapest on the 25th anniversary of Hungary’s accession to NATO, Pressman claimed that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was increasingly isolating himself from friends and allies by “saying and doing things that undermine trust and friendship.”
“We can neither understand nor accept the prime minister identifying the United States as a ‘top adversary’ of our ally Hungary,” Pressman said.
