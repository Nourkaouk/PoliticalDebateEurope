The EU’s new €5B weapons fund for Kyiv:
BRUSSELS — Europe's new €5B fund for Ukraine was lauded as a big win for Kyiv, but the program is more of an accounting procedure than an actual pile of cash.
EU countries agreed Wednesday to create the Ukraine Assistance Fund, which ostensibly boosts the bloc's off-budget European Peace Facility (EPF) with an extra €5B. The EPF is used to partially reimburse member countries for the weapons they provide to Ukraine. 
But despite its name, the "fund" won't actually see a €5 billion infusion — as bilateral weapons shipments can count as “in-kind contributions.”
