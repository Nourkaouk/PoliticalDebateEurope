EU and Switzerland are neighbours with cross border links. EU is Switzerlandâ€™s first trading partner, while Switzerland is the fourth largest partner for EU. About one and a half million EU citizens live in Switzerland, and around 450 000 Swiss citizens live in EU. A hundred thousand of EU citizens cross the border daily to work.
Since March 2022, EU and Switzerland were engaged in exploratory discussions on the future of their bilateral relations. On 15 December 2023, the Commission and the Federal Council published the Common Understanding that provides a written record of the outcome of the exploratory talks.
