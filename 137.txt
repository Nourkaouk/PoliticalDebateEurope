Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has told a crowd of cheering supporters that his government's nationalist conservative policies will win this year in Europe.
"We started this year alone, by the end of it we will be the majority in world!" he said in Budapest.
He was confident Donald Trump would win November's US presidential election and right-wing parties would win European parliament elections in June.
He then launched an attack on EU.
"If we want to preserve Hungary's freedom and sovereignty, we have no choice: We have to occupy Brussels," he said during speech to mark Hungary's national day.
