High noon for Putin: Opposition trolls Russia’s rigged election
Russia’s opposition is working morning, noon and night to give President Vladimir Putin a bloody nose in this weekend’s rigged election.
While Putin is certain to win — the only intrigue is whether he’ll surpass his own personal vote share record (77 percent in 2018) — the campaigners linked to the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny aren’t going down without a fight.
Pay particular attention to Russia at midday on Sunday.
Opposition figures have organized mass participation of voters at polling stations at 12 p.m. local time in each region across the country.
