The young people unsurprisingly picked the climate crisis over others. Under-29s were the European voters most likely to name it as their biggest concern. People aged 18 to 29 in Great Britain, France, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland picked it above all other issues.
Concern was still pretty high in the 30 to 39 (20 per cent) and 40 to 49 (22 per cent) age groups but fell to 15 per cent for the over 70s.
Men were slightly more likely (20 per cent) to name climate change as the crisis that has most affected them than women (18 per cent).
