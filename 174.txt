As it stands, Slovakia may be the first country to change its policy and stop supporting Ukraine. But there are signs other countries could follow suit. Ukraine’s recent row with Poland over grain exports has increased the prospect of a far-right, pro-Russia party winning the elections in Poland – which could halt military aid to Ukraine as well.
Meanwhile in the US, the prospect of Donald Trump winning a second term in November 2024 and stopping aid to Ukraine is a distinct possibility.
This “Ukraine fatigue”, could not only protract the war, but ultimately lead to Ukraine’s failure on the battlefield.
