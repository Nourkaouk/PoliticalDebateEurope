Tall order for Tusk
The three leaders have no shortage of thorny issues to try to iron out in Berlin: European debt financing for defense, Germany’s refusal to send long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine, and France’s relatively small contributions to the war effort — a major sticking point that the Germans have repeatedly stressed. Macron talks big on the war, but France contributes nowhere near as much Poland or Germany.
Tusk will have many cards to play, not least the fact that he runs the only country at the table that shares border with Russia — with Kaliningrad on Baltic Sea.
