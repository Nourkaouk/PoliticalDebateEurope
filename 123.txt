It’s become a bit of a catch-all term for anything or anyone that the author doesn’t like in politics, or anything that falls outside of the traditional mainstream of politics.
From an academic perspective, there is a much more set definition, which defines populism as a political ideology characterized by a seeing society as split between ‘pure’ people and corrupt elite.
This is helpful when thinking through how politics has often become a competition between populist challengers and the traditional political mainstream, and to understand how when the latter go along with that framing, they are actually feeding populist politics.
