The ascendant European Conservatives and Reformists aren’t doing the whole manifesto-and-spitz thing. But even though they’re not holding a traditional party congress, you can still schmooze with key players away from home. The party has started offering travel packages filled with lectures, sightseeing tours, policy panels and party bigwigs. There have already been trips to Washington and Bucharest, and the last weekend in March features a trip to Cyprus. Just €310 gets you roundtrip flights, two nights in a single room and access to events featuring ECR lawmakers, Cypriot Energy Minister George Papanastasiou, and Italian Undersecretary of Defense Isabella Rauti.
