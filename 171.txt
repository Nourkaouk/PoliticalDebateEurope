Along similar lines, a Cyprus scenario could unfold where the EU membership issue is fudged at the time of accession. 
Two alternatives are possible to think of if the war ends soon and with the restoration of all or part of currently Russian-occupied territories to Ukrainian sovereignty.
A Croatia-style scenario would imply a military defeat of Russia and reintegration of the country as a result. Given the current realities on the battlefield, this is highly unlikely. A Bosnia-style negotiated settlement leading to a dysfunctional state and no reintegration, but is undesirable because it would all but rule out EU accession.
