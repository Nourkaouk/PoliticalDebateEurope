What everyone agrees on: Everyone is frustrated with European Council President Charles Michel’s refusal to sign on. As we reported Tuesday, his office won’t be a member.
“The Cabinet of the President of European Council consulted Member States but there was no consensus for European Council to join the Ethics Body at this stage,” a Council representative said.
After EU Influence first reported Michel’s minimal engagement with the project in January, his team got more involved, we’ve heard, but always insisted that he didn’t have a mandate from EUCO to sign on. But that’s earned eyerolls from the other negotiators.
