It’s not surprising that people disengage from the system because they feel they don’t have a say in it. The Brexit vote is a great example; there was suddenly a spike in turnout because it gave lot of disengaged voters an opportunity to make their voices heard.
You see that almost everywhere, where lot of the support for anti-system parties often comes from people previously disengaged from the electoral system and who didn’t vote in previous elections. Another example of this is a large share of the vote for Alternative for Germany. And Donald Trump did the same in US.
