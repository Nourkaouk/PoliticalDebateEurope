Voters concerned about climate change could shape the outcome of the upcoming European elections, according to a new report.
European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) carried out polling in 11 European countries - nine EU nations that represent 75 per cent of the bloc’s population plus Great Britain and Switzerland.
The report argues that Europe’s voters are split into five ‘crisis tribes’: climate change, global economic turmoil, immigration, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine.
And those who are part of the climate change ‘crisis tribe’ could make up almost 74 million votes in the upcoming European Parliament election.
