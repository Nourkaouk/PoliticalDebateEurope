Two weeks ago, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced the country would suspend its membership in Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization, military alliance of former Soviet countries. Armenia blamed Russia for failing to ensure its security during Azerbaijan’s lightning military assault against Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023.
The current discussion only concerns the removal of Russian border guards from the airport; those stationed at Turkish and Iranian borders are not affected.
Armenia’s Security Council secretary, Armen Grigoryan, said Wednesday that an official letter was sent to Russia about the border guards being ejected, but Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov disputed this.
