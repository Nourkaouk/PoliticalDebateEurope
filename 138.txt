Mr Orban has long been at loggerheads with EU, but he told supporters that they were ahead of a "sovereignty turn" in US.
His comments are the latest salvo in a war of words with Joe Biden's administration in Washington over Hungary's position on the war in Ukraine, and international criticism of his concentration of power at home.
After meeting Donald Trump, the Hungarian leader predicted Russia's war in Ukraine would end because the new US President would not "give a penny" to Kyiv.
President Biden quickly retorted that Mr Orban "doesn't think democracy works and is looking for dictatorship".
