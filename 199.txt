The center-right and center-left alliances are almost evenly matched in pre-election polls.
LISBON — More than half of Portugal’s 10.8 million eligible voters had cast their ballots in the country’s national election as of 4 p.m. on Sunday, the electoral authority reported.
The participation rate is substantially higher than the 45 percent registered at a similar time on election day in 2022, when Portugal last held legislative voting. That 2022 vote was characterized by a high abstention rate, with nearly half of eligible voters staying home.
National Electoral Council said the figures suggested overall participation might be higher this time around.
