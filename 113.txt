In the 2000s, when the last big wave of enlargement took place, EU was in an expansive, optimistic mode.  Many of its supporters imagined it could keep enlarging almost indefinitely and form the basis for global governance. But that optimistic period came to an abrupt end with the beginning of euro crisis in 2010. 
Since then, the EU has increasingly come to see itself as being surrounded by threats and has gone into a more defensive mode â€“ European leaders now think more about protection than transformation.
The return to enlargement has taken place in the context of this new defensiveness.
