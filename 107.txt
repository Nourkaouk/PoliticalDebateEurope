Those who view climate change as the biggest crisis overwhelmingly flock to Green parties or those like the Socialists in Spain or Civic Coalition and Left in Poland.

Interestingly, climate-concerned voters share quite a few common characteristics with the other most influential group - those concerned about immigration. They both believe that if action isnâ€™t taken today, it will be difficult to implement tomorrow.
