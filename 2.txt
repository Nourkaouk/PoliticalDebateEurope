With European elections, we elect our representatives to the European Parliament. But they were not always so. Like so many European decisions, they were a compromise. In 1970s, the European Parliament called for more democracy in European Community, with itself at the center. Member states wanted to give in to elections, but prevent elected MEPs from calling the shots in Brussels. In 1979, the first European elections were a reality.
European elections still work at their core as they were conceived at the time, with all their shortcomings. They have little influence on the formation of the new European Commission.
