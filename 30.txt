Phil Chetwynd, global news director of AFP, told BBC Radio 4’s “The Media Show” that the agency works “all the time” with Kensington Palace, so it would consider it trusted source. But now, the agency will be “more vigilant” about the content it receives.
“No, absolutely not,” Chetwynd said, when asked if the Palace was still a trusted source. “Like with anything, when you’re let down by a source the bar is raised.”
Last weekend, several news agencies issued “kill notices” for Mother’s Day photo released by Kensington Palace, which showed the Princess of Wales embracing her three smiling children.
