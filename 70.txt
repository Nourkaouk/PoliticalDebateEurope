Armenia’s Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan announced that Russia has been informed its border guards are no longer welcome at Yerevan’s Zvartnots Airport.
“The Armenian side has informed [the Russian side] that it does not need [anymore] the border guard service of Russian border guards at the airport; of course, thanking the Russian side,” Mirzoyan said. 
Mirzoyan explained that back in 1992 the presence of Russian border guards at Zvartnots was initially intended as a temporary measure to support Armenian independence. “We now believe that Armenia has the institutional capacity to independently implement border guard services at the airport,” he added.
