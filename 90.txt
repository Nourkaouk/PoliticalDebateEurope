The Commission has put forward proposals for draft negotiating frameworks for Ukraine and Moldova to the Council following the decision by European Council in December 2023 to open negotiations and will give oral report to the Council on the progress made by both countries to address the recommendation made in the Commissionâ€™s Enlargement report of the 8th November.
The negotiating frameworks establish the guidelines for the accession negotiations with each candidate country. The draft frameworks prepared by the European Commission are divided into three parts: 1) principles governing the accession negotiations, 2) substance of the negotiations, and 3) negotiations procedure.
