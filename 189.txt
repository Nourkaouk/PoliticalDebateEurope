Last weekend Bardella hammered on the far right's central theme of immigration when the party launched its election campaign in Marseille.
Members of the opposition have accused the president of using the conflict to boost his coalition's standing ahead of European elections. 
Bardella described Macron's stance on Ukraine as "no limits and no red lines".
He said he had pleaded with the French leader "not to go to war with Russia" in talks earlier this week.
Bardella dismissed the attacks on his party as "unhealthy obsession".
"Nothing on Europe, nothing on France, nothing for the French," he posted on X.
