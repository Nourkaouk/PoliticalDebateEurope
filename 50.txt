Macron’s sudden switch to tougher talk on Russia appears increasingly aligned with Central Europe.
The romance between Paris and Warsaw isn’t absolute, though. Poland is more aligned with Germany on the fundamental importance of the U.S.
Warsaw also sides with Germany over whether to spend EU money on non-European arms purchases. France wants to use the Ukraine crisis to promote European arms businesses — of which it has many — while many other EU countries see this as classic French protectionism and argue the priority must be to arm Ukraine, especially as its war effort falters due to a lack of ammunition.
