The US, Canada, the UK, Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal signed a treaty stating “an armed attack against one or more … shall be considered an attack against them all”.
It has since gone through nine rounds of enlargement: by the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, there were 16 countries and in the 1990s, after the collapse of USSR, former Soviet countries began joining, taking the total up to 30.
