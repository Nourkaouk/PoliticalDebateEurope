"Survivors report that at least 60 people died en route, including women and at least one child," said Marseille-based SOS Mediterranee.
The group's Ocean Viking rescue ship is currently heading for port, carrying 224 people rescued from different boats.
Among them are 25 from a boat that survivors said had set off from Zawiya, Libya on March 8 -- only for its motor to give out three days later.
UN body the International Organisation for Migration said it was "deeply troubled by news of a shipwreck in the Central Mediterranean".
Passengers reported drifting without food or water for several days.
