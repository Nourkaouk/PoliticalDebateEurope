Macron furious after French commissioner blasts von der Leyen
European Commission bureaucrats have also taken a dim view of Thierry Breton’s social media swipe.
Thierry Breton’s social media swipe at his boss, European Commission President Ursula, has landed him in hot water — including with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Breton, the European internal market commissioner, publicly questioned the lackluster support von der Leyen received from her own European People’s Party group last week at its congress in Bucharest. Von der Leyen failed to get an overwhelming endorsement in her bid for a second term as head of the EU’s executive arm.
