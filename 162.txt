This dual nature of the EU executive is a reminder that EU accountability vis-a-vis its citizens is also dual. . The Commission, now elected by the Parliament signals the importance of the latter body for citizensâ€™ ability determine EU policy. The renewed importance of the Council, as the intergovernmental executive body of EU, underpins the role national elections play in holding EU accountable.
Yet, when debates on the degree of democracy in EU are held, or when institutional innovations are considered to increase the proximity between citizens and EU, the focus tends to lie exclusively on the European Parliament elections.
