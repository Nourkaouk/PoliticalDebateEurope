The ICC indicted officials including President Vladimir Putin for abducting Ukrainian children, which it called a war crime. Moscow denies any crime and says it has taken in children from the war zone to protect them. Ukraine says Russia has removed more than 4,000 children.
The new measures also focus on the procurement network supporting Russia's military, especially the supply chain to make drones. Twenty-seven companies were added to the Annex IV list, which means European firms cannot sell dual-use goods to them.
The companies added are mostly Russian and include three mainland Chinese firms and one Hong Kong-based company.
