The votes for the Freedom Party in the Netherlands signal the continuation of the far-right gaining a foothold in European politics, and will further endanger the EUâ€™s unified position vis-a-vis Ukraine. There are further national elections in EU member states in 2024, as well as the European Parliamentary elections.
Already, four European Union member states have right-wing parties in power. It will become increasingly difficult to negotiate support packages for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia among member states, and pass these through the European Parliament. The longer-term prospect of Ukrainian accession to the European Union may also be at risk.
