That’s the million-euro question but a convincing case is set out by Philip Manow in the Chatham House paper The political economy of populism in Europe. He argues good explanation can be found in the types of hyper-globalization shocks to hit a specific polity, and by the domestic political structures of those countries.
The argument is that when it comes to migration, that often leads to right-wing protests. When it’s more economic, you see left-wing protests. But it should be noted that left-wing populist parties remain quite a small phenomenon, and arguably a rather time-limited one in much of Europe.
