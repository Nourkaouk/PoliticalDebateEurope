Cyberattacks of "unprecedented intensity" have targeted several French government institutions
The latest cyberattack to hit France follows a warning from Attal's defence adviser just last week that the Olympics games in July and European Parliament elections in June could be "significant targets".
Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's office said several state bodies were targeted but did not provide details.
"Many ministerial services were targeted" from Sunday "using familiar technical means but of unprecedented intensity," Attal's office said.
A security source told AFP that the attacks "are not currently attributable to Russia," an obvious suspect for many given Paris' support for Kyiv.
