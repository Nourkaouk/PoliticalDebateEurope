U.S. Ambassador to Hungary David Pressman criticized the country’s “dangerously unhinged anti-American messaging” on Thursday.
In a fiery speech at Central European University in Budapest on the 25th anniversary of Hungary’s accession to NATO, Pressman claimed that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was isolating himself from friends and allies by “saying and doing things that undermine trust and friendship.”
“We can neither understand nor accept the prime minister identifying the United States as a ‘top adversary’ of our ally Hungary,” Pressman said. “Or his assertion that the United States government is trying to overthrow the Hungarian government — literally, to ‘defeat’ him.”
