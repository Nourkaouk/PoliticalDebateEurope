Dominici voiced greater optimism about the text’s prospects in parliament, playing down suggestions from some quarters that the bid for Corsican autonomy may have been set up to fail.  
“Macron has crossed Rubicon by backing autonomy and recognising Corsican culture,” he said. 
The Corsica analyst noted that critics of autonomy had been more guarded in their response, suggesting they may yet be persuaded to back the proposal. They include Jean-Martin Mondoloni, head of conservative opposition in the Corsican regional assembly, who reiterated his misgivings about the text, though adding: “I am not going to take on the role of executioner”.
