“France restates its unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognised borders,” he said in a joint statement with Moldovan President as she visited Paris.
Two years into Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, Moldova faces “multiple challenges caused by the conflict on its borders”, the statement said.
Top of the list is the pro-Russian breakway region of Transnistria, where officials appealed to Moscow for “protection”.
There is mounting concern that the territory could become a new flashpoint in the conflict, with Moldova “facing intensifying hybrid attacks”, the two presidents said.
