Impact on Dutch support for Ukraine:
Regardless of who will become the next Dutch prime minister, a majority of seats for the Freedom Party is bad news for Ukraine. The Freedom Party wants to halt military and financial support for Ukraine. It does not support EU’s sanctions on Russia. EU accession – the EU’s main security guarantee for Ukraine – is rejected by both the PVV and the NSC.
This matters, because maintaining support for Ukraine will be going into a crunch period and ensuring EU continues to provide this will be a pivotal election outcome. US support for Ukraine might wane.
