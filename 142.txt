The law, a revised version of a bill rejected in January, received 178 votes in the 350-seat chamber.
The amnesty aims to remove pending legal action against people accused of separatist activity, mainly stemming from a 2017 Catalan bid for secession.
Socialist Party spokesman Patxi LÃ³pez said the amnesty helped "end a period of conflict and open a time of reconciliation and unity".
The most high-profile potential beneficiary of the law is former Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont, who led the failed independence attempt and has been living in Belgium ever since, to avoid the reach of the Spanish courts.
