Studies have shown, by analysing political actorsâ€™ statements in media, that EU politicisation is a punctuated phenomenon, varying across countries and regions. Moreover, when it comes to the overall media coverage, Silva et al. (2022) demonstrated that the Eurozone crisis not only increased the levels of EU politicisation in the bailout countries but it also led to a higher awareness, or salience, of the different institutions of the EU. These existing studies on the magnitude of politicisation, however, do not consider important differences within the media and in the dimensions of the EU that can be the object of contestation.
