Although the opposition Popular Party has a majority in the Senate, it cannot block the legislation, which the PP says is unconstitutional and gives Catalan nationalists preferential treatment. 
Sánchez has presented the legislation, known as the Amnesty Law for Institutional, Political and Social Normalization in Catalonia, as an attempt to reduce tensions in northeastern region of the country. It follows his government’s pardoning of nine jailed separatist leaders in 2021.
However, the opposition has accused the prime minister of using the law to secure the parliamentary support of Junts and the ERC in order to keep his fragile government alive.
