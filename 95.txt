The Sweden’s road to membership of NATO has been a long one. In July 2023, the country’s bid to join NATO was finally approved by Türkiye, which had been blocking its application pending Sweden recognizing rebel groups as terrorist organizations.
On 10 July, NATO said: “Sweden has amended its constitution, changed its laws, significantly expanded its counter-terrorism cooperation against the PKK, all steps set out in the Trilateral Memorandum agreed in 2022.”
Both Sweden, and Finland, which has a 1,340km border with Russia, dropped their traditional stance of neutrality and applied to join NATO after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
