Every year, The Parliament, the leading publication for the European Union's Institutions, recognises and celebrates the hard work and accomplishments of MEPs and presents awards to honour their outstanding achievements.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of The Parliament’s MEP Awards.

Coinciding with the European Parliament’s last year before elections in June, the celebration will be a sit-down gala dinner, offering the opportunity to network with over than 200 European policy makers.
