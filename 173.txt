There are 25 political parties fielding candidates and, based on the two latest polls, eight or nine of them are likely to pass the threshold of 5% support required to be allocated seats in the country’s system of proportional representation.
This results in coalition governments and comes with inbuilt insecurity as coalition parties fall out and collapse. Hence Saturday’s election, which comes after only three years of a four-year term in which there have been three different prime ministers.
The party thought likely to win the most votes is Progressive Slovakia, led by Michal Šimečka, a vice-president of European parliament.
