The PM's staff added that a "crisis cell has been activated to deploy countermeasures", meaning that "the impact of these attacks has been reduced for most services and access to state websites restored."
Specialist services including the information security agency ANSSI were "implementing filtering measures until the attacks are over".
Several hacker groups claimed responsibility for the attacks on Telegram, a messaging app, including one calling itself Anonymous Sudan which said it had launched a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on French government network infrastructure.
"We have conducted a massive cyberattack... the damage will be widespread," said the group.
