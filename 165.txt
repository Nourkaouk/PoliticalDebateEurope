Yet, differences do emerge between countries on how European Union policies are debated. Namely, in Ireland, Spain and Portugal, European Union policies are mostly discussed in the context of their effect on national policies. But in Germany, European Union policies are discussed in a broader context.

But we found that the more EU policies were mentioned in the media, the more they impact how people vote.
