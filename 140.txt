Centre stage in US-Hungary row is the Hungarian government's demand for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, its opposition to military aid for Kyiv, and Hungary's regular meetings with top Russian officials, including Viktor Orban's encounter with President Vladimir Putin last October in Beijing.
"The Hungarian policy is based on a fantasy that disarming Ukraine will stop Putin. History shows it would do the reverse. It is not a proposal for peace; it is capitulation."
Mr Orban's conservative nationalist Fidesz party has been in office since 2010 and Biden administration is at loggerheads with the government over its understanding of democracy.
