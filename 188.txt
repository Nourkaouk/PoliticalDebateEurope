Macron has picked Valerie Hayer, the 37-year-old head of the Renew group in European Parliament, to lead his camp in the polls.
A daughter of French farmers, Hayer is relatively unknown to the public.
"In this campaign we will be the only ones to defend Europe," she said.
"In three months, we will face a choice: act or suffer, strengthen our Europe or give up in the face of those who want to tear it down," Hayer added.
The head of the National Rally's list for the European elections is 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a rising star of far-right French politics.
