And France has expressed more clearly its vision of European defense as “in addition to and not instead” of the Atlantic alliance, added the diplomat, who was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.
Paris has noted the positive signs Warsaw has sent in recent days. Even if Tusk denied plans to send troops to Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said it was “not unthinkable” to put NATO boots on the ground.
