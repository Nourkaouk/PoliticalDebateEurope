Debates about reform show a striking contrast between France and the UK on the one hand and Germany on the other. France and the UK are extremely centralized, especially in comparison to Germany with its federal system and powerful independent institutions such as the constitutional court. 
When considering proportionality in electoral systems, the Netherlands is the most proportional electoral system in Europe as essentially it has one single constituency, and the UK is one of the least proportional because of the first-past-the-post system. France and Germany are in between, with France closer to UK and Germany closer to the Netherlands.
