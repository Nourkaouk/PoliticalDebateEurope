The timing of this political falling out could be worse. Donald Trump’s return to power in the U.S. is no longer a long shot, and Europe faces real danger of having to contend alone with Russia’s onslaught against Kyiv.
The three-way meeting in Berlin caps weeks of acrimonious bickering, some of it spilling over in public, between Macron and Scholz on European defense and Ukraine. Macron’s pronouncement that Western troops shouldn’t be “ruled out” in Ukraine was met with a curt rebuff from Scholz, while French president’s later call that Europeans shouldn’t be “cowards” was slammed as unhelpful in Berlin.
