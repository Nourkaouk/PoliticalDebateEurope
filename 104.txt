Bashkim Kasoruhu, head of Albanian Railways, Project Implementation Unit, told Euronews, that the rail projects will have a huge economic impact, improving transport links inside Albania, the wider Balkan region and Europe. 
“Connectivity is the most important aspect. You can imagine the impact of connecting these biggest ports. The port [Durres], [Tirana] airport and Tirana city centre where we have the public transport terminal will gather all the infrastructure in one hub," he said.
Once finished, a new rail link between Durres and Tirana, Albania’s two biggest cities, will cut the 40-minute road trip in half to around 20 minutes.
