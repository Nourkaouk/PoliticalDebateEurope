It’s difficult because many of the choices that led up to where we are now made sense by themselves: the importance of monetary policy, central bank independence. The same goes for some areas of economic policy, which are often outsourced or constrained by rules because it makes for more consistent policy.
Reversing that is difficult and it also benefits the mainstream parties to continue with this cultural cleavage in politics. You see that in the way these elections and campaigns play out is that they choose to engage as the one against the ‘challenger’ and make the election about that.
