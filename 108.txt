Emmanuel Macron warned Western powers against showing any signs of weakness to Russia as he reiterated his position that sending Western troops into Ukraine shouldn't be ruled out.
The French President admitted that today’s situation doesn’t require it.
In an interview on French national television TF1 and France 2, Macron was asked about the prospect of sending Western troops to Ukraine, which he publicly raised last month.
His comments prompted pushback from other European leaders who stressed they had no plans to do so.
"We’re not in that situation today," he said, but added that “all these options are possible.”
