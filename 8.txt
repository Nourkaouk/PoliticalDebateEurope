The legal basis for the European Community now rests on two treaties: The Treaty of Rome of 1958; and The Treaty of Maastricht of 1992. The various additions and modifications of treaties has led to a patchwork of policy and planning, which contributes to the unwieldiness of the European Union. The pastiche of treaties, and not a single actualising charter of government, form the constitutional basis of the European Union. This ambiguity is what critics call a primary cause of "democratic deficit."
The European Union itself is a legal personality and a set of governing institutions empowered by the treaties.
