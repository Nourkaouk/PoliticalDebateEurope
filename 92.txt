Two days after the second anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the final hurdle in Sweden’s path to joining the world’s most powerful military bloc was cleared, as Hungary approved of its accession.
 “We are joining NATO in order to defend what we are and everything we believe in even better. We are defending our freedom, our democracy and our values, together with others.”
It comes less than a year after Sweden’s neighbour, Finland, joined in April 2023, marking the biggest expansion of NATO since members joined from eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
