Putin, first elected president in 2000, has spent years tightening his grip over Russian society and clamping down on any form of dissent against his rule. Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was the catalyst for increased domestic repression, and the once-thriving opposition movement led by Navalny has been quashed.
Putin’s celebratory concert is already planned for Moscow’s behemoth Luzhniki Stadium on Monday, and his own press secretary revealed last year that the president “will be reelected next year with more than 90 percent of the vote” because Russia’s presidential election “is not really democracy, it is costly bureaucracy.”
