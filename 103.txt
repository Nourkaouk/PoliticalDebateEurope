To help pave the way for Western Balkan countries to join the bloc, Brussels designed a stabilisation and association process. This sets out the political objectives for the region. 
A lack of convergence between countries in the Western Balkan region and the rest of Europe remains a major sticking point for allowing them EU membership. This currently sits at around 35 per cent of the EU's average levels. 
Economic convergence is sometimes described as the 'catch-up effect' or the circumstances that enable a country with a slower level of development and economic growth to catch up with a 'wealthier' country.
