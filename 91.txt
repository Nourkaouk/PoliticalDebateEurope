Sweden has officially joined NATO, in what the bloc’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg described as a “historic day”.
“Sweden will now take its rightful place at NATO’s table, with an equal say in shaping NATO policies and decisions,” said Stoltenberg on 7 March 2024.
“Sweden’s accession makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer and the whole Alliance more secure. Today’s accession demonstrates that NATO’s door remains open and that every nation has the right to choose its path.”
The country’s flag will be raised alongside those of the other 31 Allies in a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels on 11 March.
