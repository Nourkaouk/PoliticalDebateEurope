Kate Middleton photo scandal links Palace to North Korea and Iran, news chief says:
“Like with anything, when you’re let down by a source the bar is raised,” said AFP’s global news director.
Kensington Palace is no longer a “trusted source” of information after it released manipulated picture of Kate Middleton and her children, according to the head of Agence France-Presse.
After the manipulation was detected by a horde of digital sleuths, AFP issued a “kill notice” for the photo, something which is very rarely done — and usually only with content originating from Iranian and North Korean state media sources.
